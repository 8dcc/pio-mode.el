#+TITLE: PIO Mode
#+AUTHOR: 8dcc

*Major mode for editing [[https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/what-is-pio/][PIO]] assembly files.*

This package provides two major modes for editing PIO assembly files.  First,
=pio-mode=, which inherits from =asm-mode= and highlights the base assembly syntax.
Second, =poly-pio-mode=, built on top of the [[https://github.com/polymode/polymode][polymode]] package, which adds support
for the embedded C blocks.

The Programable I/O state machines were originally developed for the RP2040
microcontroller by Raspberry Pi. Through /bit-banging/, they allow the programmer
to interact with existing or new hardware interfaces efficiently.
